# SmartPlateRecognition_YOLO_OpenCV  

## Overview  
**SmartPlateRecognition_YOLO_OpenCV** is a system designed to automatically detect and read license plates from images or videos. It leverages cutting-edge computer vision techniques and machine learning, specifically using the YOLO object detection model and OpenCV, to provide accurate and efficient license plate recognition.  

This solution is ideal for applications such as:  
- Traffic monitoring  
- Parking management  
- Security systems  

## Key Features  
- **High Accuracy:** Detect and read license plates in various lighting and weather conditions.  
- **Real-time Processing:** Supports real-time video stream analysis for live detection.  
- **Versatility:** Works with images, pre-recorded videos, and live camera feeds.  
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for easy deployment in different systems and platforms.  

## Technology Stack  
- **YOLOv8**: Object detection for identifying license plates.  
- **OpenCV**: Image and video processing for preprocessing and visualization.  
- **Pytesseract & EasyOCR**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for extracting text from detected license plates.  
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development.  

## Project Structure  
- **Dataset Preparation:** Collect and preprocess image data for training the YOLO model.  
- **Model Training:** Train a custom YOLOv8 model for license plate detection.  
- **Image Preprocessing:** Enhance images for better OCR performance.  
- **OCR Integration:** Extract text from license plates using OCR models.  
- **Live Demo:** Real-time license plate recognition using video streams or camera inputs.
